During my internship with Oasis Infobyte, I had the invaluable opportunity to dive into the world of data science and work on five diverse projects. Over the course of my internship, I contributed to five significant projects, each of which allowed me to acquire valuable skills and specialize in various areas.

✨One of my significant accomplishments was the "Iris Classification project", where I employed machine learning algorithms to accurately classify different species of iris flowers based on their features. 

✨Additionally, I conducted an in-depth "Analysis of unemployment" rates, utilizing statistical techniques and data visualization to gain insights into the factors affecting employment trends.

✨Another notable project was the development of a "car price prediction system", where I applied regression models to predict the prices of vehicles based on various attributes. 

✨Moreover, I contributed to the creation of an "email spam detection system", leveraging natural language processing techniques to identify and filter out unwanted emails.

✨Lastly, I worked on a "Sales price prediction System" system, utilizing machine learning algorithms to forecast the prices of products based on historical sales data. Through these projects, I gained practical experience and honed my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.
